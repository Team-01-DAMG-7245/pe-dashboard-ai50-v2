Shaping the future of AI and, in turn, the future of our world is a responsibility and a privilege. Our values guide how we work together, the decisions we make, and ultimately how we show up for each other and work toward our mission.01Act for the global good.We strive to make decisions that maximize positive outcomes for humanity in the long run. This means weâre willing to be very bold in the actions we take to ensure our technology is a robustly positive force for good. We take seriously the task of safely guiding the world through a technological revolution that has the potential to change the course of human history, and are committed to helping make this transition go well.02Hold light and shade.AI has the potential to pose unprecedented risks to humanity if things go badly. It also has the potential to create unprecedented benefits for humanity if things go well. We need shade to understand and protect against the potential for bad outcomes. We need light to realize the good outcomes.03Be good to our users.At Anthropic, we define âusersâ broadly. Users are our customers, policy-makers, Ants, and anyone impacted by the technology we build or the actions we take. We cultivate generosity and kindness in all our interactionsâwith each other, with our users, and with the world at large. Going above and beyond for each other, our customers, and all of the people affected by our technology is meeting expectations.04Ignite a race to the top on safety.As a safety-first company, we believe that building reliable, trustworthy, and secure systems is our collective responsibilityâand the market agrees. We work to inspire a ârace to the topâ dynamic where AI developers must compete to develop the most safe and secure AI systems. We want to constantly set the industry bar for AI safety and security and drive others to do the same.05Do the simple thing that works.We take an empirical approach to problems and care about the size of our impact and not the sophistication of our methods. This doesnât mean we throw together haphazard solutions. It means we try to identify the simplest solution and iterate from there. We donât invent a spaceship if all we need is a bicycle.06Be helpful, honest, and harmless.Anthropic is a high-trust, low-ego organization. We communicate kindly and directly, assuming good intentions even in disagreement. We are thoughtful about our actions, avoiding harm and repairing relationships when needed. Everyone contributes, regardless of role. If something urgently needs to be done, the right person to do it is probably you!07Put the mission first.At the end of the day, the mission is what weâre all here for. It gives us a shared purpose and allows us to act swiftly together, rather than being pulled in multiple directions by competing goals. It engenders trust and collaboration and is the final arbiter in our decisions. When it comes to our mission, none of us are bystanders. We each take personal ownership over making our mission successful.Technical InterviewsThe novel challenges we think about at Anthropic demand diverse expertise and perspectives. Our interview process is designed to identify thoughtful candidates who bring unique strengths to our multidisciplinary team. If you think this may describe you, weâd love to hear from you regardless of your background or experience.One of the most common questions we get is about whether it is worth applying to work at Anthropic if you have not worked on modern machine learning systems in the past. Yes! For some roles, ML experience is expected, but many technical staff have arrived at Anthropic with no machine learning experience. If you arenât sure about the ML experience needed for your role, ask your recruiter.We use shared environments like Colab and Replit for our programming-focused interviews. Weâll be very interested in how you think through each problem and analyze the tradeoffs between possible approaches, and weâll also expect you to write, run, and debug your solutions. Youâll be allowed to look things up in documentation or on the web, just like you usually can (which is why weâll ask you to share your screen throughout each interview); but itâs still important to be familiar with basic syntax, standard libraries, and common idioms in the language youâre interviewing in, so that looking things up doesnât consume too much time. Your interview process will also include non-technical questions about your experience and what motivates you, and, of course, youâll have time to ask us about Anthropic! We canât wait to meet you.Other ThingsEngineers here do lots of research, and researchers do lots of engineeringWhile thereâs historically been a division between engineering and research in machine learning, we think that boundary has dissolved with the advent of large models. The distribution of candidates we interview is strongly bimodal in both engineering and research experience however, and we have necessarily tailored our interview structure to that.If youâve an engineering background, please apply as an engineer. Youâll perform much better in the interviews, and if you join youâll have as much input to Anthropicâs direction and interests as anyone else.As evidence towards this: all of our papers have engineers as authors, and often as first author. Research and engineering hires all share a single title â âMember of Technical Staffâ.We value direct evidence of abilityIf youâve done interesting independent research, written an insightful blog post, or made substantial contributions to open-source software, put that at the top of your resume!FeedbackWe do not provide feedback on resumes or interviews.VisasAnthropic sponsors visas! We arenât able to sponsor them for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.Green cardsOnce youâre eligible, weâre also keen to sponsor green cards!Educational backgrounds and experience vary across our team and across our rolesWe do not require PhDs or previous ML experience â About half of Anthropic technical staff have a PhD of some sort; about half had prior experience in ML. We have several brilliant colleagues who never went to college.Remote interviewingAll our interviews are conducted over Google Meet. We prefer PST office hours, but we can be flexible if thatâs difficult for you.Re-applyingSimilarly, if interviews donât work out this time, youâre welcome to re-apply after 12 months, and earlier if something materially changes about your experience or skills.Remote workAnthropic staff all come to the office regularly. Most staff live in the Bay Area, though a few live further away and come in for one week a month. We also understand that moving can take time, so as a transitional phase some folks start while fully remote.Offer timingIf we make an offer, weâre happy to give you time to think about it and finish up any other interview processes youâre going through.Candidate Privacy PolicyUS Candidate Privacy PolicyIndia Employee and Candidate Privacy PolicyAU, UK, EU, CH, KR AND JP Employee and Candidate Privacy PolicyAU, UK, EU, CH, KR AND JP Employee and Candidate Privacy Policy (in French)AU, UK, EU, CH, KR AND JP Employee and Candidate Privacy Policy (in Japanese)InternshipsWe do not offer internships.Guidance on Candidatesâ AI UsageLearn about our policy for using AI in our application process.Want to help us build the future of safe AI?See open rolesSee open rolesSee open rolesFooterÂ© 2024 Anthropic PBCProductsClaudeClaude CodeClaude and SlackClaude in ExcelMax planTeam planEnterprise planDownload appsPricingLog in to ClaudeModelsOpusSonnetHaikuSolutionsAIÂ agentsCode modernizationCodingCustomer supportEducationFinancial servicesGovernmentLife sciencesClaude Developer PlatformOverviewDeveloper docsPricingAmazon BedrockGoogle Cloudâs Vertex AIConsole loginLearnCoursesConnectorsCustomer storiesEngineering at AnthropicEventsPowered by ClaudeService partnersStartups programCompanyAnthropicCareersEconomic FuturesResearchNewsResponsible Scaling PolicySecurity and complianceTransparencyHelp and securityAvailabilityStatusSupport centerTerms and policiesPrivacy choices Cookie Settings We use cookies to deliver and improve our services, analyze site usage, and if you agree, to customize or personalize your experience and market our services to you.
