Customer story
Steve Januario
VP of Technology
Calibrations, email, presentations, content creation, etc., have gotten so much easier. I've seen stats that say Glean saves people 2-3 hours of time a week, but I know it's saving me a lot more time than that, and if you're not using Glean today, you really should be.
Steve Januario
VP of Technology
Casey Carlton
Director of IT & Business Tech
In my previous roles, I looked at and tried out tools that said they could handle enterprise search, both on-prem and Saas-based, but nothing worked. So, I was skeptical at first. However, Glean quickly proved that my skepticism was invalid.

Customer story
Manu Narayan
VP of IT, Data & Business Operations
It seems every SaaS platform has added some kind of generative feature, but they only have a single window of context. Glean brings the same thoughtful approach they brought to search to enterprise Al.
