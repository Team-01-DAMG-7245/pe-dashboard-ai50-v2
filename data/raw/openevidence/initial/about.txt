About | OpenEvidenceOpenEvidence has signed content agreements with JAMA and The New England Journal of Medicine. Log InSign UpOpenEvidence is the leading medical information platform.Launched from the Mayo Clinic Platform Accelerate programFeaturing multimedia and clinical findings from The New England Journal of MedicineFeaturing multimedia and clinical findings from JAMA and the JAMA Network specialty journalsOur mission is to organize and expand the world's collective medical knowledge.OpenEvidence is what we always imagined when we used to talk about someone finally solving medical search.Information overload is an extreme challenge in medicine.The amount of medical research published annually is doubling every 5 years.[1] Such a rate of change makes it nearly impossible for the world’s physicians, medical researchers, and healthcare professionals to monitor and understand all the latest research literature and clinical evidence relevant to their work.To tame the medical information firehose, we built OpenEvidence to aggregate, synthesize, and visualize clinically relevant evidence in understandable, accessible formats that can be used to make more evidenced-based decisions and improve patient outcomes.TeamDaniel NadlerPhD, HarvardTIME100 Most Influential People in HealthZachary ZieglerPhD Candidate, HarvardWorked with Alexander RushJonas WulffPost-Doc, MITPhD, MPI for Intelligent SystemsWorked with Antonio TorralbaMicah SmithPhD, MITWorked with Kalyan VeeramachaneniEvan HernandezPhD, MITWorked with Jacob AndreasEric LehmanPhD, MITWorked with Peter SzolovitsFernanda FerreiraPhD, HarvardJames EsdailePhD, HarvardFormerly @ Kensho TechnologiesAndy YoonBS, Computer Science, UCLAEthan JosephMEng, Computer Science, Cornell TechJagath Jai KumarMS, Computer Science, UMass AmherstFormerly @ GoogleOliver RenMEng, Computer Science, MITStephen PolcynBSE, Computer Science, PrincetonVarun MangalickBS, Computer Science and Mathematics, MITRobert McKenzieAB, Statistics, HarvardSam GilmanBA, Computer Science, WilliamsReese GreenBS, Computer Science and Mathematics, CU BoulderAakriti LakshmananMS, Computer Science, StanfordBenedict NeoMS, Data Science, USFKush KhoslaMS, Computer Science, StanfordFounder @ Amaro (Acquired by OpenEvidence)Sauren KhoslaMS, Computer Science, StanfordFounder @ Amaro (Acquired by OpenEvidence)Neel Patel-ShahBA, Cognitive Science, BerkeleyFormerly @ Amaro (Acquired by OpenEvidence)Dylan LyMS, Product Design, StanfordFormerly @ Amaro (Acquired by OpenEvidence)Marc LeefM.
