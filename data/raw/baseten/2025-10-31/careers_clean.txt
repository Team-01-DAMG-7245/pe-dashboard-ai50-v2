‌
Our team spent weeks researching and vetting inference providers. It was a thorough process and we confidently believe Baseten was a clear winner. Baseten has helped us abstract away so much of the complexity of AI model deployments and MLOps. On Baseten, things just work out of the box - this has saved us countless engineering hours. It’s made a huge difference in our productivity as a team - most of our engineers have experience now in training and deploying models on Baseten. Every time we start an ML project, we think about how quickly we can get things going through Baseten.
Baseten cut our P95 latency by 80% across the dozens of fine-tuned embedding models that power core features in Superhuman's AI-native email app. Superhuman is all about saving time. With Baseten, we're delivering a faster product for our customers while reducing engineering time spent on infrastructure.
