Baseten has hands down provided both. We really appreciate the level of commitment and support from your entire team.Sahaj Garg,Co-Founder and CTOWith Baseten, we gained a lot of control over our entire inference pipeline and worked with Baseten's team to optimize each step.Lily Clifford,Co-founder and CEORime's state-of-the-art p99 latency and 100% uptime is driven by our shared laser focus on fundamentals, and we're excited to push the frontier even further with Baseten.Isaiah Granet,CEO and Co-FounderYou guys have literally enabled us to hit insane revenue numbers without ever thinking about GPUs and scaling. We would be stuck in GPU AWS land without y'all. Truss files are amazing, y'all are on top of it always, and the product is well thought out. I know I ask for a lot so I just wanted to let you guys know that I am so blown away by everything Baseten.Waseem Alshikh,CTO and Co-Founder of WriterInference for custom-built LLMs could be a major headache. Thanks to Baseten, we're getting cost-effective high-performance model serving without any extra burden on our internal engineering teams.
