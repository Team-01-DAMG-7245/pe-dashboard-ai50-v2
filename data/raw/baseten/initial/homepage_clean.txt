You guys have literally enabled us to hit insane revenue numbers without ever thinking about GPUs and scaling. We would be stuck in GPU AWS land without y'all. Truss files are amazing, y'all are on top of it always, and the product is well thought out. I know I ask for a lot so I just wanted to let you guys know that I am so blown away by everything Baseten.

Inference for custom-built LLMs could be a major headache. Thanks to Baseten, we're getting cost-effective high-performance model serving without any extra burden on our internal engineering teams. Instead, we get to focus our expertise on creating the best possible domain-specific LLMs for our customers.
