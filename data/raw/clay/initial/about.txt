That requires deep research which, historically, demanded huge investments in tooling, money, and manual labor.We help combine 1st-party data, intent data, and 3rd party data from 100+ external enrichment in one place for people to do deep customer research.With Clay, a single person can run growth campaigns that previously required coordinating the entire GTM team. This means companies can send fewer, better messagesâand only to people who are a good mutual fit. Sales representatives can focus on nurturing customer relationships and closing deals.The Clay crewWho we areWe're a kind, creative team with quiet egos.
