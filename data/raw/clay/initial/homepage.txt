We have tripled our enrichment rate with Clayâs combination of data providers vs. our previous solution. We're using the best aggregate results across a waterfall of data sources, and implementing complex workflow logic even beyond enrichmentâof course powered by AI. Clay makes it easy to use AI for GTM initiatives, unlocking new workflows that were infeasible before."Adam WallHead of Sales Operations"Clay is a central part of our outbound campaign program. Itâs helped us fully automate lead enrichment that previously required expensive and time consuming manual research. We can use the hours we've saved on manual work for more interesting, creative, and important tasks, like coming up with new outreach ideas or nurturing relationships with prospects."Davide GriecoDirector of Growth"Clay saves us hours a week that we previously spent researching and vetting companies that applied to our startup program. Our auto-approval rate has jumped to ~40%âwith no manual work needed."Josh KimHead of Growth Programs"Scaling inefficient SDR work isnât possible without an infinite flow of capital. Clay helps automate mundane tasks like contact data enrichment, including pulling signals and triggers, so SDRs can focus their time on prioritized selling and spend their days more effectively. It evolves the SDR role and aligns it with better with marketing paths for more upward career momentum."Kris RudegraapCEO"Not having Clay would hugely reduce our ability to run good outbound campaigns. We wouldnât be calling people as much, because itâs hard to get good phone numbers. We wouldnât be emailing as much, because weâd be likely to bounce or go to spam. With Clay, we have a reliable source of data enrichment and can run dynamic, multi-touch outreach sequences."Julien ReimanHead of Sales"Clay is the Rippling marketing team's secret weapon.
