Our Story
In 2020, Hebbia was one of the first companies to productionize LLMs, pioneering retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
Since then we’ve raised 4 rounds of financing and hired exceptional humans from around the world.
Today, we’ve evolved far beyond chat-based interfaces and RAG. Matrix tackles even the most complex tasks using our proprietary ISD architecture.
The world’s leading financial, legal, consulting, and Fortune 100 firms are already using Matrix to teach AI agents their unique process, and do entirely new kinds of work.
We are the world experts at applied AI, pushing the limits of what's possible in reasoning and human-computer interaction.
Hebbia is the AI you were promised.
