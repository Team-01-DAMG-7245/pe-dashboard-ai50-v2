It looks like your ad blocker is preventing the video from playing.Our storyEarly computing pioneers envisioned a future where machines on our desks could amplify our imagination, extend our intellect, and help us model information in ways never before seen. This is the type of tool we want to build together at Notion — one that gives you the software you can mold and shape like clay to solve your problems your way.We’ve heard Notion described many ways. It can be as simple as a blank piece of paper, making writing feel light and delightful. It can be as complex as a relational database that stores huge amounts of data. We sometimes compare it to a set of Legos (if Legos were designed by The New York Times). But at its core, Notion is a toolbox of software building blocks that let you manage your life and work however you find most useful.To make this possible, we’ve brought together a diverse team of individuals passionate about computing, history, art, alternative programming languages, music, skateboarding, and craft.

New York, New YorkWe believe the best companies bring together diversity in race, age, physical and mental ability, sexuality, gender identity, ethnicity, perspectives and ideas. And people do their best work when they feel like they belong — included, valued, and equal. This is the Notion we want to build, where everyone brings their full selves to work knowing that they’ll be heard, championed, and supported to succeed. We hope you’ll join us.☕ Office cultureNotion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of the week in the office (including a third day).Being an in-office-focused company enables us to capitalize on the energy that comes from us being in the same place. This is a great opportunity to build relationships, work with your teammates, and collaborate on projects. Teams have started adding a third in-office day for team-based work for things such as group maker time, brainstorm sessions, team bonding, and more! This way, Notinos spend the majority of the week in the office.📕 Interview guidesWe want to help every candidate feel prepared and know exactly what to expect.
