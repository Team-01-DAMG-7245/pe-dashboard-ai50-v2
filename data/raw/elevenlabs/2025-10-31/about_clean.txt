The voice of technology. Bringing the world's knowledge, stories and agents to life.
We’re backed by leading names
ElevenLabs is an AI audio research and deployment company. As voice becomes a primary interface for using technology, we build AI that makes these interactions effortless and human.
We began with ultra-realistic AI voices - clear, expressive, and multilingual. Today, we advance AI audio across speech, sound effects, and music, and turn that work into products people use every day.
Through our Agents Platform and Creative Platform, teams deploy voice agents that listen, talk, and act, localize content at scale, tell stories, and improve accessibility. Our models speak over 70 languages and are used by businesses to run and scale in production, and by others to teach, support, connect, and create.
Our aim is to make interacting with computers as natural as talking to a person - bringing the world’s knowledge, stories, and agents to life.
