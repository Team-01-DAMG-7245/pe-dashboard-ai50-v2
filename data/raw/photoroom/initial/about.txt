There was just one problem… the designer was OOO.Determined to help, Matt opened a clunky photo editing tool and began painstakingly tracing the edges of each object in the image with the lasso tool. Hours later, he had a finished asset and a newfound frustration.That long night stuck with Matt.Months later, while swapping ideas with Eliot - an engineer who saw the potential of AI before the rest of us caught on - he realized he wasn’t alone. He hit a bottleneck many teams know: creating fast, beautiful visuals eats hours. For a business, that means slower launches, stale listings, and sales left on the table.Today, Photoroom helps entrepreneurs, marketers, and global teams produce high-quality content without the traditional bottlenecks. From automated editing to AI-generated scenes, we’re building the future of visual creation.Because we’re not just great at removing backgrounds. We’re removing the barriers between great ideas and great visuals.HiringJoin us to shape the future of product photographyWe’re always looking for talented, driven people from diverse backgrounds to bring fresh perspectives and join our team.See openingsUpdatesPhotoroom featured on This Week in Startups: Our journey to 300M usersEmbracing radical openness: How a “No DM” Slack policy drives impact at Photoroom The Photoroom 2024 diversity report: Beyond the DEI backlashPlaying to win: the unexpected way we innovate at PhotoroomWe’re training a text-to-image model from scratch and open-sourcing itThe value of values: What we learned from an afternoon spent drawing AxolotlsFollow usFree toolsAll AI toolsAI BackgroundsAI ShadowsAI ExpandnewAI ImagesnewMagic RetouchBackground RemoverBlur BackgroundAdd Text to ImageOutline imageFree templatesFree background imagesFree appsOn the webiPhone appAndroid appAPI (developers)API Status (developers)CompanyAbout usPricingPress KitCustomer storiesBlogJob openingsCompany blogLinkedInImpact & SustainabilityCommunityHelp & legalContact supportFacebook communityTerms & conditionsEnterprise Services Agreement Privacy policyCookie policySecurityContact salesLegal© 2025 Photoroom, Inc.
